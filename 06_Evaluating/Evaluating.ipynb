    "A universal method you can use to deeply study how well any of your supervised learning predictors is doing is by using a **confusion matrix**. <br>\n",

    "This helps you see how well your algorithm was able to generalize and identify specific target labels, along with which labels were often\n",

    "This can be helpful in increasing your accuracy, because you can then engineer additional features that help to better identify highly confusing targets, and then take another run through your data analysis pipeline. <br>\n",
    "Traditionally, the predicted targets are aligned on the X-axis of the matrix, and the true values are aligned on the Y-axis. Let's say you have the following data:"

    "<br>\n",
    "On the other hand, there were two dogs in the dataset. The model somehow came to the conclusion that one of the monkey's was a dog, and din't even arrive at two dog predictions. It looks like you trained a non-dog friendly model. Regarding monkeys, there were two in the dataset. One of them, the algorithm predicted correctly. The other, the model thought was a dog. It looks like there is some level of confusion here between monkeys and dogs. This is a good indicator that you might consider adding additional feature to your dataset, such as banana-affinity."
